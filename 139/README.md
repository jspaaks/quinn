## CMake

The project has been initialized with a [CMakeLists.txt](CMakeLists.txt)-based
configuration for building with CMake:

```console
# change into the build directory
$ cd build/

# generate the build files
$ cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ..

# build the project
$ cmake --build .

# install the project to <repo>/build/dist
$ cmake --install . --prefix dist/

# run the program to see if it works
$ ./dist/bin/sequential
```
<!--
Should output something like:

```text

```
-->

## Address sanitizing

To use address sanitizing, you may need to install an extra dependency, e.g. like so:

```console
# (Ubuntu)
sudo apt install libasan8
```

The CMake variable `SEQUENTIAL_WITH_ASAN` can be used to enable address sanitizing on the
executable `sequential`. `SEQUENTIAL_WITH_ASAN`'s value is `OFF` by default. To
enable it, configure the build via `ccmake ..`, or via a command line argument with:

```console
$ cmake -DSEQUENTIAL_WITH_ASAN=ON ..
```
