## CMake

The project has been initialized with a [CMakeLists.txt](CMakeLists.txt)-based
configuration for building with CMake:

```console
# change into the build directory
$ cd build/

# generate the build files
$ cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ..

# build the project
$ cmake --build .

# install the project to <repo>/build/dist
$ cmake --install . --prefix dist/

# run the program to see if it works
$ ./dist/bin/reference
```

Should output something like:

```text
-- test compile definitions
   DEBUG compile definition has been defined.

-- test wether math library was linked
   sqrt(144) = 12.000000

-- test c2x / c23 features
   0 1 2 3 4

-- test own library
   divide(2, 3) = 0
   multiply(2, 3) = 6

```

## Testing

Building and running the tests requires that [Criterion](https://github.com/Snaipe/Criterion) is
installed on the system, e.g. with

```console
$ sudo apt install libcriterion3 libcriterion-dev
```

Run the tests with

```console
$ ./dist/bin/test_operations -j1 --verbose
```

The CMake variable `OPERATIONS_BUILD_TESTING` can be used to build the
tests.

- When this project is the top project, `OPERATIONS_BUILD_TESTING` inherits the value of
  CTest's `BUILD_TESTING`, which is set to ON by default.
- When this project is not the top project but instead it is used as a dependency to a parent
  project, the default is to not build the tests. However, building the tests is still possible by
  setting the `OPERATIONS_BUILD_TESTING` to `ON`, e.g like so:

```console
$ cmake -DOPERATIONS_BUILD_TESTING=ON ..
```

## Address sanitizing

To use address sanitizing, you may need to install an extra dependency, e.g. like so:

```console
# (Ubuntu)
sudo apt install libasan8
```

The CMake variable `REFERENCE_WITH_ASAN` can be used to enable address sanitizing on the
executable `reference`. `REFERENCE_WITH_ASAN`'s value is `OFF` by default. To
enable it, configure the build via `ccmake ..`, or via a command line argument with:

```console
$ cmake -DREFERENCE_WITH_ASAN=ON ..
```
